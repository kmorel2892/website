Welcome to the digital platform of a dedicated physics graduate student committed to unraveling the intricacies of the cosmos. 
Focused on the exploration of the profound Crab Nebula, a celestial phenomenon steeped in historical fascination, my research endeavors center on the application of advanced astrophysical methodologies and theoretical frameworks. 
This platform serves as an invitation to accompany me on a scholarly journey into the depths of the universe. 
Through meticulous investigation, I aim to elucidate the fundamental processes shaping the Crab Nebula, contributing substantively to the broader comprehension of the universe's extraordinary phenomena. 
I extend a formal welcome to all who wish to engage with the frontiers of astrophysics through the lens of my ongoing research endeavors.
Kim Morel is an incoming PhD student in the Department of Physics at McGill University working under the supervision of Prof. Adrian Liu. She completed her MSc degree at Université de Montréal as a member of the Trottier Institute for Research on Exoplanets. After studying other worlds within our own galaxy, she now wants to expand her research to the entire cosmos. Her project focuses on 21 cm cosmology, which traces the distribution of matter in the Universe. The goal is to create a 3D map of this matter, providing insights into the evolution of the Universe since looking far away in space is akin to looking back in time. Ultimately, it will help constrain key aspects of the Universe's expansion, galaxy formation, dark matter, and fundamental physics, including General Relativity.
