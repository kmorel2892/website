Hello! I'm Kim Morel (she/her), a PhD student and Tomlinson Fellow at McGill University. I work in 21 cm cosmology, using the radio interferometer HERA to map the distribution of matter in the early Universe. My focus is on removing foreground contaminants from the data to isolate the 21 cm signal. Additionally, I have a background in exoplanet research and experience analyzing data from JWST.

I can be reached at [kim.morel@mail.mcgill.ca](mailto:kim.morel@mail.mcgill.ca).
