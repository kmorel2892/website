# Research Interests

I am mostly interested in observational 21 cm cosmology, a field named after the 21 cm wavelength at which hydrogen — the simplest element in the Universe — emits photons, i.e., light. These photons are detectable by radio telescopes, such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), which provides the data I utilize to work on a new method for foreground removal. Foreground contaminants pose a significant challenge in 21 cm cosmology because they are much brighter than the cosmological 21 cm signal. Therefore, an accurate subtraction of these foregrounds is crucial to successfully detect the cosmological signal.

# Past Research

During my Master's degree, I was part of the Trottier Institute for Research on Exoplanets at the Université de Montréal. I studied the atmospheres of exoplanets using data from the
Near-InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrogrpah (NIRISS) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In particular, I studied the atmosphere of the warm Jupiter WASP-80 b, in which we
suggested the presence of aerosols, i.e., clouds or hazes, given that light from its host star is reflected on its surface. Studying exoplanet atmospheres provides insight into their formation history, which ultimately helps us understand our own Solar System.
