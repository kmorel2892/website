# Research Interests

I am mostly interested in observational 21 cm cosmology. This name comes from the fact that hydrogen, the most simplest element in the Universe, emits photons, i.e., light, at a
wavelength of 21 cm. These photons can be seen by radio telescopes such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), which is the telescope whose data I use to work on a new
foreground removal method. Foreground contaminants are an important issue in 21 cm cosmology since they are much brighter than the 21 cm signal. It is therefore essential that we subtract
them in order to detect the cosmological signal.

# Past Research

During my Master's degree, I was part of the Trottier Institute for Research on Exoplanets at the Université de Montréal. I studied the atmospheres of exoplanets using data from the
Near-InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrogrpah (NIRISS) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In particular, I studied the atmosphere of the warm Jupiter WASP-80 b, in which we
suggested the presence of aerosols, i.e., clouds or hazes, given that light from its host star is reflected on its surface.

Here's an artist representation of WASP-80 b:
