              The Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) is the science module of the Canadian-built Fine Guidance Sensor onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). NIRISS has four observing modes: (1) broadband imaging featuring seven of the eight NIRCam broadband filters, (2) wide-field slitless spectroscopy at a resolving power of ∼150 between 0.8 and 2.2
              μ
              m, (3) single-object cross-dispersed slitless spectroscopy (SOSS) enabling simultaneous wavelength coverage between 0.6 and 2.8

              m at
              R
              ∼ 700, a mode optimized for exoplanet spectroscopy of relatively bright (
              J
              {\textless} 6.3) stars and (4) aperture masking interferometry (AMI) between 2.8 and 4.8
              μ
              m enabling high-contrast (∼10

              M
              {\textless} 8) sources. This paper presents an overview of the NIRISS instrument, its design, its scientific capabilities, and a summary of in-flight performance. NIRISS shows significantly better response shortward of ∼2.5
              μ
              m resulting in 10\%–40\% sensitivity improvement for broadband and low-resolution spectroscopy compared to pre-flight predictions. Two time-series observations performed during instrument commissioning in the SOSS mode yield very stable spectro-photometry performance within ∼10\% of the expected noise. The first space-based companion detection of the tight binary star AB Dor AC through AMI was demonstrated.},

              The Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph instrument (NIRISS) is the Canadian Space Agency contribution to the suite of four science instruments of the James Webb Space Telescope. As one of the three NIRISS observing modes, the Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) mode is tailor-made to undertake time-series observations of exoplanets to perform transit spectroscopy. The SOSS permits observing point sources between 0.6 and 2.8

              m at a resolving power of 650 at 1.25
              μ
              m using a slitless cross-dispersing grism while its defocussing cylindrical lens enables observing targets as bright as
              J
              = 6.7 by spreading light across 23 pixels along the cross-dispersion axis. This paper officially presents the design of the SOSS mode, its operation, characterization, and its performance, from ground-based testing and flight-based commissioning. On-sky measurements demonstrate a peak photon conversion efficiency of 55\% at 1.2
              μ
              m. The first time series on the A-type star BD+60°1753 achieves a flux stability close to the photon-noise limit, so far tested to a level of 20 parts per million on a 40 minute timescale after simply subtracting a long-term trend. Uncorrected 1/

              noise residuals underneath the spectral traces add an extra source of noise equivalent to doubling the readout noise. Preliminary analysis of an HAT-P-14b transit time series indicates that it is difficult to remove all of the noise in pixels with partially saturated ramps. Overall, the SOSS delivers performance at the level required to tackle key exoplanetary science programs such as detecting secondary atmospheres on terrestrial planets and measuring abundances of several chemical species in gas giants.},
