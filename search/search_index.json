I'm Kim Morel (she/her), a PhD student and Tomlinson Fellow at McGill University. I work in 21 cm cosmology, using the radio interferometer HERA to map the distribution of matter in the early Universe.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Physics with a concentration in Astrophysics at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (UdeM), where I first began my journey in astrophysics research at the Trottier Insitute for Research on Exoplanets (IREx). I remained affiliated with IREx and supervised by Prof. David Lafreni\u00e8re throughout my Master's degree at UdeM, where I studied the atmosphere of exoplanets, i.e., planets outside the Solar System, using data from the James Webb Sapce Telescope (JWST).</p> <p>After studying other worlds within our own galaxy, I am now expanding my research to the entire cosmos. I'm pursuing my doctoral studies at McGill University in Prof. Adrian Liu's research group. My project focuses on observational 21 cm cosmology, which traces the distribution of matter in the Universe. The goal is to create a 3D map of this matter, providing insights into the evolution of the Universe since looking far away in space is akin to looking back in time. Ultimately, it will help constrain key aspects of the Universe's expansion, galaxy formation, dark matter, and fundamental physics, including General Relativity.</p> <p>Beyond academia, I'm actively involved in scientific outreach events, as I'm committed to making research accessible to the public and demystifying the work done in my field. I also aim to show how one can transition from a passion for science to a dedicated career in research. Additionally, I work with young students as a teaching assistant and hold a key position in the organization InitiaSciences.</p>"},{"location":"about/#other-interests","title":"Other Interests","text":"<p>Outside of academia, here are a few of my passions:</p> <ul> <li>Pandas</li> <li>Reading</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/#cv","title":"CV","text":""},{"location":"about/pandas/","title":"Pandas","text":"<p>There are just so funny and cute!

I studied the atmospheres of exoplanets using data from the Near-InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrogrpah (NIRISS<sup>2</sup>) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In particular, I studied the atmosphere of the warm Jupiter WASP-80 b using secondary eclipse data. Secondary eclipses happen when an exoplanet passes behind its star during its orbit, leading to a slight brightness decrease in the total flux we receive from the system as the star momentarily blocks the light coming from the orbiting planet. They allow us to study the planet\u2019s thermal emission and the starlight it reflects. For WASP-80 b, we\u2019ve discovered that some of the star\u2019s light is being reflected because we can see a glow at certain wavelengths where the planet itself doesn\u2019t give off much heat. This suggests the presence of aerosols, i.e., clouds or hazes, as they are responsible for this reflection. We've also constrained the albedo of the planet, i.e. the fraction of reflected light, to better precision than ever before.</p> <p>Warm and hot jupiters are interesting objects, as they do not exist in the Solar System. By characterizing their atmosphere, we can obtain information about their formation and evolution.</p> <p>Our paper on this research was recently submitted!</p> <p></p> <p>Artist's representation of WASP-80 b.
