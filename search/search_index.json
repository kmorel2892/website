I'm Kim Morel (she/her), a PhD student and Tomlinson Fellow at McGill University. I work in 21 cm cosmology, using the radio interferometer HERA to map the distribution of matter in the early Universe. My focus is on removing foreground contaminants from the data to isolate the 21 cm signal. Additionally, I have a background in exoplanet research and experience analyzing data from JWST.</p> <p>I can be reached at kim.morel@mail.mcgill.ca.</p> <p>Find more about:</p> <ul> <li>Me</li> <li>My research</li> <li>My outreach and community involvement</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Kim Morel has always been passionate about the Universe and the fact that it's still widely unknown, which inspired her to pursue a career in studying it. She completed her Bachelor's degree in Physics with a concentration in Astrophysics at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (UdeM), where she first began her journey in astrophysics research at the Trottier Insitute for Research on Exoplanets (IREx). She remained affiliated with IREx and supervised by Prof. David Lafreni\u00e8re throughout her Master's degree at UdeM, where she studied the atmosphere of exoplanets, i.e., planets outside the Solar System, using data from the James Webb Sapce Telescope (JWST).</p> <p>After studying other worlds within our own galaxy, she is now expanding her research to the entire cosmos. She is pursuing her doctoral studies at McGill University in Prof. Adrian Liu's research group. Her project focuses on observational 21 cm cosmology, which traces the distribution of matter in the Universe. The goal is to create a 3D map of this matter, providing insights into the evolution of the Universe since looking far away in space is akin to looking back in time. Ultimately, it will help constrain key aspects of the Universe's expansion, galaxy formation, dark matter, and fundamental physics, including General Relativity.</p> <p>Beyond academia, Kim is actively involved in scientific outreach events, as she is committed to making research accessible to the public and demystifying the work done in her field. She also aims to show how one can transition from a passion for science to a dedicated career in research. Additionally, she works with young students as a teaching assistant and holds a key position in the organization InitiaSciences.</p>"},{"location":"about/#other-interests","title":"Other Interests","text":"<ul> <li>Pandas</li> <li>Reading</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/#cv","title":"CV","text":""},{"location":"about/pandas/","title":"Pandas","text":"<p>There are just so funny and cute!
